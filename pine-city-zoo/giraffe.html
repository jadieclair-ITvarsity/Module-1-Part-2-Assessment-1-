            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
            <p>
              The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed
              ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the
              largest ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like shape
              and its leopard-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing
              characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its
              horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is
              classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest
              extant relative, the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished
              by their coat patterns.
              <br />
              <br />
              The giraffes scattered range extends from Chad in the north to
              South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia
              in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and
              open woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which
              they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.
              <br />
              <br />
              Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by
              leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. Adult giraffes do
              not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose
              aggregations if they happen to be moving in the same general
              direction. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking",
              which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.
              Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole
              responsibility for raising the young.

            <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
            <p>
              You will find the Giraffes at G15, just beyond the research
              centre.
