            <h3>TIGERS</h3>
            <p>
              The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and
              a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its
              black stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex
              predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild
              boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social
              predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support
              its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs
              stay with their mother for about two years and then become
              independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their
              own.
              <br />
              <br />
              The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. India
              hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population
              decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and
              poaching. Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict, due
              to encroachment in countries with a high human population density.
              <br />
              <br />
              The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the
              world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in the
              ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic
              range and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature,
              appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting
              teams. The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh,
              Malaysia and South Korea.
