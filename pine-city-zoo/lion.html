            <h3>LIONS</h3>
            <p>
              The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus
              Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used
              term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies
              found in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in
              weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.
              <br />
              <br />
              Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia
              (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest
              National Park in India) while other types of lions have
              disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic
              times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the
              lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They
              were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe
              to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.
              <br />
              The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population
              decline in its African range of 30 to 50% per two decades during
              the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are
              untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although
              the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and
              conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of
              concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is
              particularly endangered.
