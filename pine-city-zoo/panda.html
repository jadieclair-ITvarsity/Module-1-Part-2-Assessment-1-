            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
            <p>
              PANDAS The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also known as
              panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central
              China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black
              patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
              The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from
              the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora,
              the Giant Pandas diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas in the wild
              will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in
              the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may
              receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas
              along with specially prepared food.
              <br />
              The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China,
              mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring provinces,
              namely Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation,
              and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the
              lowland areas where it once lived.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Giant Panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.
