            <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
            <p>
              Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that
              inhabit the forests of central Africa. The eponymous genus Gorilla
              is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western
              gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest
              living primates by physical size. The DNA of gorillas is highly
              similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is
              counted, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans
              after the chimpanzees and bonobos.
              <br />
              <br />
              Gorillas natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in
              Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa,
              gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla
              inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga
              Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200
              to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland
              swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland
              gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern
              lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
              near its border with Rwanda.
